## Assignment: API calls on Celebrity page

This assignment will test your ability to implement an API call to gather data.  
You will then create inputs to search the database you have called, and use a
combination of HTML/Javascript/React to display your data.  Your knowledge of React
will be particularly important for this lesson, as you will have to convert your previous
HTML/Javascript/CSS code into proper React format.  

1. Your HTML will become JSX in React format.
2. You will have to properly export your APIandCallDisplay component into your Content file.
3. You must also properly import your APIandCallDisplay component into your Content file.
4. Be sure to understand the code format and data flow by reading the instructions carefully
and completely first.  It is also just as important to review your React conversion, other
changes, and data flow after finishing the assignment.  
5. Remember the difference between CSS tag attributes with and without React.
6. Pay special attention to import/export and file organization.
